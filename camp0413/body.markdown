- Don't go too far, Illian!

The girl ignored the warning as was usual, never answering, always going
deeper. There was something about the tunnel which made her creep forward, day
after day, lighting her many stops with Everfyre as she needed time to move
obstacles and rest and eat lunch.

On good days, she could reach the 15k mark before a single flare burned out. On
less-good days, she would inevitably trip on debris, curse herself and others
for not clearing the way properly, lose the flare, fumble with her pockets to
find another, feel just generally tired, or even find an old book that was not
too shabby and sit there, reading. She prefered good days, though: the thrill
of potentially discovering many-a-thing among the age-old dust, or of finding
the ever-unlikely-but-oft-rumored fork in the road, offset everything else.
