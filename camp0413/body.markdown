- Don't go too far, Illian!

The girl ignored the warning as was usual, never answering, always going
deeper. There was something about the tunnel which made her creep forward, day
after day, lighting her many stops with Everfyre as she needed time to move
obstacles and rest and eat lunch.

On good days, she could reach the 15k mark before a single flare burned out. On
less-good days, she would inevitably trip on debris, curse herself and others
for not clearing the way properly, lose the flare, fumble with her pockets to
find another, feel just generally tired, or even find an old book that was not
too shabby and sit there, reading. She prefered good days, though: the thrill
of potentially discovering many-a-thing among the age-old dust, or of finding
the ever-unlikely-but-oft-rumored fork in the road, offset everything else.

And on the walk went. This particular day, she would only reach the 10k mark
before stopping and starting back. She had planned to go all the way to the end
and continue creating a way through the mess she had hit the previous day. It
wasn't the worse she had seen, but it was pretty bad: the rubble was dense but
light, and each move, each step, would cause clouds of white dust and dirt to
billow up and settle down on coats and arms and legs, and irritate the throat
and nose of the only living thing in there. She had planned to go with tools,
but the weight and space required meant she had left her Everfyres behind. She
had figured she wouldn't need them. And on any other day she would have figured
right.

On that day, though, she was perplexed to find a wall of darkness greeting her
just over half a k from the 10k mark.
