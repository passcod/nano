- You want me to go _where_?

That was the standard response to Illian's question today. Exasperated, she
fumed while walking away:

- Why is everyone here so fucking cowardly?!

- Language, Illian, language. You should understand… Fear is quite the powerful
  emotion, especially when one's life is routine.

- Uncle! I—

She turned, stopped, looked confused for an instant before flashing her eyes in
anger and swatting the boy standing there— or tried to, anyway. Mark was tall
for his mere twelve years, but still as springy as some of his youger friends,
and easily dodged. He laughed while jumping further back to avoid being
grabbed, and imitated another voice, producing deeper bass than his age should
have allowed, in a strange performance of a man's voice coming from a youth's
body.

- Aah, Illian, do you want me that much?

- You pathetic little— come here! Mark! I will strangle that voicebox of yours,
  come here you pest!

Keeping his distance, he dropped all pretense and, casually:

- Y'know, _I_ could go down with you.

- And why would I want that?

He raised an eyebrow and stopped jumping around. Illian, troubled, turned away
and mumbled an okay. She walked to the nearest service door, paused, hesitated,
then asked Mark to bring a knapsack and lunch.

- And get some sleep, you freak!

- We're not going right now?

- I want to get some air.

Spending days walking the length of the tunnel and nights sleeping in her room
under the lake might have been Illian's routine, but that didn't mean she had
forgone the outside. Much to the contrary! _I will go find something useful
from underneath, if the overside is barred to us._ Thus went her original
thought on the matter. Later she stopped making excuses, both for herself and
others, and just accepted she liked it down there. Hence, fresh air was, to her
only, a luxury, a treat to be given or taken depending on progress or, in
this case, lack thereofe. Reaching the surface was long enough but the view was
spectacular, taking away her breath everytime. Or maybe that was just the
altitude.

Perched up just a few meters down from the ridge line of the lake side
mountains, the E00 hatch  was the only manmade flaw as far as eye could see. On
that side, at least. From the northern side, one could see, on good days, the
shining walls of the Crossing Fort, and at night, the faint halo of the
permanent _veilleuse_ at the Lighthouse-on-the-Ridge. E01, the northern hatch,
was merely an observatory for these two. The lighthouse has not been lit and
bright in living memory, and many doubted it was still manned; watch was kept
out of tradition, and also because it provided a distraction to staring at the
seemingly random opening and closing of gates through binoculars for days on
end.

To the east, the tall strip of concrete of the highway was clearly visible. To
the west, there was mostly white fog, which marked the _dead zone_. So-called
_dead zones_ were a permanent result of the past. They had a constant layer of
something that looked like mist but seemed not to be affected by wind nor rain
nor sun nor anything else natural or otherwise. No wildlife came close. The
only things brave or foolish enough to come near were humans— but even we knew
not to go in nor get too close: _dead zones_ take but do not give back.
