- You want me to go _where_?

That was the standard response to Illian's question today. Exasperated, she
fumed while walking away:

- Why is everyone here so fucking cowardly?!

- Language, Illian, language. You should understand… Fear is quite the powerful
  emotion, especially when one's life is routine.

- Uncle! I—

She turned, stopped, looked confused for an instant before flashing her eyes in
anger and swatting the boy standing there— or tried to, anyway. Mark was tall
for his mere twelve years, but still as springy as some of his youger friends,
and easily dodged. He laughed while jumping further back to avoid being
grabbed, and imitated another voice, producing deeper bass than his age should
have allowed, in a strange performance of a man's voice coming from a youth's
body.

- Aah, Illian, do you want me that much?

- You pathetic little— come here! Mark! I will strangle that voicebox of yours,
  come here you pest!
